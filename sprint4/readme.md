1. Many of you need to try to use the software you built for a day or two and open new bug reports. Then prioritize them with the understanding that we will be using those final projects to do what your READ me files say they do in the end. Your scope can change, and you have limited time left. 
    - Our wrapper worked fairly well, but we found that the edge case support is rather lacking. We prioritized getting the DoSOCSv2 wrapper to support edge cases so it wouldn't crash when we hit one. After that, we agreed to work on trying to get our pieces working together so an end user could user our software.

2. Use the issues to write more complete and comprehensive bug reports for what you find. You do not have to fix every "bug" or add every feature, but use those tools to communicate with each other about how things are going.
    - Multiple issues have been rewritten to be more concise, and updates have been written on them to communicate outside of a group chat we have.

3. Decide what bugs need fixing.
    - As mentioned in (1), the bugs we prioritized were edge-cases for our DoSOCSv2 wrapper. Most of the other work we completed fit more squarely into the 'feature' catagory, such as connecting our pieces.

4. Update your developer instructions to ensure they are written so another person in the class, who has been working on a different project all semester, has a fighting chance to install and configure your system. 
    - [Here](https://github.com/computationalmystic/augur-group13/blob/master/sprint4/developerinstructions.md) is a link to our developer instructions. We added instructions pertaining to DoSOCSv2 and Augur development
