# Sprint 3, Due May 5, 2019 at 11:59pm

## The Basic Assignment

### All Teams
1.  Complete, clear issues entered in GitHub defining the work you need to do, as defined in the "issue completion and clarification sub-assignment". 
    - Close any issues you complete
    - DO NOT DELETE ANY ISSUES
    - For teams that are still "technically" struggling, participate in specialized office hours this coming week (TBD).    
2. Open new issues as they arise. Many of these will be technical glitches or configuration items. 
3. Make sure each new issue is assigned to a person or persons
4. **Write Detailed records as "issue comments" on each issue as you work on them. Describe your progress during each period of effort, even if you accomplish nothing.**
5.  Build a "developer-instructions.md" document in your repository, explaining how to install and deploy it, including any database changes. 
6.  "End User Test" your system. Have 2 people you know try to use it, and for each issue they encounter, create an issue in GitHub. 
7.  You will not have to solve every issue by the end of the semester, though you should certainly try. 

### Augur Teams (You can get this by reviewing your commits!)
1. [Construct a complete list of new files you created and/or modified in the project](https://github.com/computationalmystic/augur-group13/blob/master/sprint3/addedandmodified.md)
