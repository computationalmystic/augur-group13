##User Interaction
A user, likely a communtiy or corporate project manager, will use this software to evaluate license-related risk associated with open-source projects. The user will locate the github page of a project they would like to view risk metrics about, paste it into a text box on the front-end, and send it to the back-end with a button press. From there, the backend will check to see if any up-to-date risk metrics for the submitted repository are avaliable in our database. If they are, they should be returned rather quickly and the user will have reached the end of their use-case. If not, we will inform the viewer that the repository needs the be (re)scanned and to check back later. We will also encourage the viewer to not repeatedly send the same request to the server over and over and explain that the scanning process often takes a while.
